# Weather-Data-Pipeline
This project is an Apache Airflow DAG that automates fetching daily weather data for Nairobi (city ID: 184745) from the OpenWeatherMap API and storing it in a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline collects metrics like temperature, humidity, weather description, and wind speed, saving them with timestamps for data analysis.
